### Business Problem                                                 

In e-commerce marketing, one of the most important issues is the correct calculation of the after-sales service to the products. 
The method that we will use to solve this problem is as follows:
*Providing greater customer satisfaction for the e-commerce site
*Bringing a product into prominence for the sellers
*Unproblematic shopping experience for the buyers

Another issue is the correct ordering of the comments given to the products. The misleading comments will directly affect the sale of the product so it will cause both financial loss and loss of customers. The solution of these 2 basic situations will increase the sales of the e-commerce site and the sellers, while the customers will complete the purchasing journey without any problems.
